# Locate the IP Address from a website

This code checks the user's IP address to determine whether access to a certain web page should be allowed or denied.

The first part is the standard HTML declaration which includes information about the web page such as document type, language, metadata, title and style sheets.


The body of the page has a div element with the class 'centre', which will centre the elements it contains.
The PHP code uses the `file_get_contents` function to get the geographical information from the IP address using the `ipinfo.io` website.
Then it checks if the 'country' property exists and if it does, if the user's country is France. If so, access to the page is allowed.

Otherwise, access is denied and an error message is displayed, indicating the user's IP address and the name and flag of his home country.

[!] **Note also that the code includes a file called "codes.php" which should contain an associative array of country codes and country names.**

## In case of error


If access to the site is denied, the <div> is displayed in `#FF0000` (red)
```css
.center {display: flex;justify-content: center;align-items: center;height: 100vh;}
.error {background: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.4);padding: 10px;border-radius: 5px;}
```

## Including the `codes.php` file

For this project, I use _include_ but you can also use the following instructions :
```php
require("codes.php");

require_once("codes.php");

include("codes.php");

include_once("codes.php");
```

Use `require` to include and run a file, and generate a fatal error if the file cannot be included.

Use `require_once` to include and run a file only once, which can avoid multiple re-inclusions and the potential errors that come with them.

Use `include` to include and run a file, but generate a warning instead of a fatal error if the file cannot be included.

Use `include_once` to include and run a file once, but generate a warning instead of a fatal error if the file cannot be included.

_It is important to choose the right type of instruction depending on the need for code and error handling in your application._

The file includes the name, flag and international code of all countries in the world, here is an example:
```php
$countryCodes = array(

    'FR' => 'France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·',
    'GB' => 'United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§',
    'KR' => 'South Korea. ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·',
    'JP' => 'Japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ',
    [...]
);
```

## Get the geographical information from the IP address


We use the `file_get_contents` function to get the geographical information from the IP address ( with -> ipinfo.io ) :
```php
$ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
$info = json_decode(file_get_contents("http://ipinfo.io/{$ip}/json"));
```

---
## Check the `country` property


In this example, we check if the 'country' property exists and if so, if the user's country is France ( code = FR )

```php
    if (property_exists($info, 'country') && $info->country === "FR") {

            // [FR] On autorise l'accÃ¨s au site
            // [GB] Access to the site is allowed
            echo "<div>Your IP address is from France! Welcome to our website :D<br>Your IP address is : " . $ip."</div>";
    }     

```

Otherwise, access is denied by displaying the user's IP address, as well as the name and flag of his country retrieved from the table in the `codes.php` file

```php
    } else {
   
            $country = property_exists($info, 'country') ? (array_key_exists($info->country, $countryCodes) ? $countryCodes[$info->country] : 'inconnu') : 'inconnu';
            echo "
                    <div class='error'>
                        Sorry, this website is only accessible to users with an IP address located in<strong> France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·</strong><br><br>
                        Your IP address is : <strong>". $ip."</strong>, and it comes from <strong>".$country."</strong>
                    </div>";
    }

```
